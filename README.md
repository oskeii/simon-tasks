# Todo Application
A full-stack task management application built in the hopes of simplifying my own productivity workflow. Designed with a philosophy that aims to increase productivity and executive coordination whilst decreasing mental strain and energy burnout. The system reduces context-switching through task-batching, supports energy-budgetting, and even eliminates the dilemma of infinite choice. 

Projected features include smart task suggestions, time-logging, activity tracking with time/energy/context correlations, and daily check-ins for workflow optimization.

```

## Quick Start
**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Git

```bash
# > Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oskeii/my-todo-app.git
cd my-todo-app

# > Backend environment setup
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile 
pipenv shell
    # --> `--ignore-pipfile`Â ensures that the exact versions in the Pipfile.lock are installed, avoiding version mismatches.

# > Database setup and server start
cd backend
python manage.py migrate # Run migrations
python manage.py runserver # Start the server


# > Frontend setup (in a separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000

### Demo Access
You may create a user account from the login page. However, if you would like to load some demo data into the application first, the following will create a demo user with tasks and everything. It will also create an admin account for you to access Django's admin panel.
```bash
# Navigate to backend (from root directory)
cd backend
# Run this command
python manage.py setup_demo
# NOTE: 
  # append with `--no-reset` to keep current database
  # append with `--skip-admin` if you don't want to create an admin user, or would prefer to set this up manually
```
>[!WARNING]
> Once again, if you do not want to wipe the entire database with this command, please be sure to enter `python manage.py setup_demo --no-reset`

- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin/
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `adminpass123`
- **Demo User**:
  - Username: `see message in terminal`
  - Password: `demopass123`
